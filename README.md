## Installation

```bash
$ pip install doeasyeda
```

## Package Content

This package offers four primary functions, each harnessing the power of the Altair visualization library to create distinct types of plots. These functions provide extensive customization options to cater to diverse data visualization needs.

### Functions:

This package includes four main function:

1. `create_scatter_plot(df, x_col, y_col, size=60, color=None, title=None, x_title=None, y_title=None, tooltip=None, interactive=False, width=None, height=None)`: Generates a scatter plot using the Altair visualization library with various customization options.
2. `create_hist_plot(df, x_col, y_col, color=None, title=None, x_title=None, y_title=None, tooltip=None, interactive=False, width=None, height=None)`: Generates histogram using the Altair visualization library with various customization options.
3. `create_line_plot(df, x_col, y_col, size=1, color=None, title=None, x_title=None, y_title=None, tooltip=None, interactive=False, width=None, height=None)`: Generates a line plot using the Altair visualization library with various customization options.
4. `create_area_plot(df, x_col, y_col, color=None, title=None, x_title=None, y_title=None, tooltip=None, interactive=False, width=None, height=None)`: Generates an area plot using the Altair visualization library with various customization options.

### Common Parameters:

* `df` (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame containing the data for visualization.
* `x_col`, `y_col` (str): Names of the columns to be used for the x and y axes, respectively.
* `color` (str, optional): Column name for color encoding, defaults to `None`.
* `size` (int, optional): Marker size, default 60.
* `title`, `x_title`, `y_title` (str, optional): Titles for the plot and axes, default `None`.
* `tooltip` (list of str, optional): List of column names for tooltips, defaults to `None`.
* `interactive` (bool, optional): If `True`, enables interactive features such as zooming and panning, defaults to `False`.
* `width`, `height` (int, optional): Dimensions of the chart, defaults to `None`.

## Why doeasyeda?

**doeasyeda** positions itself as a valuable addition to the Python ecosystem, particularly in the realm of data visualization and EDA. While it shares its fundamental objective with existing packages like [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) and [Dtale](https://pypi.org/project/dtale/), which provides comprehensive EDA reports with a single line of code, **doeasyeda** differentiates itself by focusing on customizable, individual plot generation. While pandas-profing is excellent for generating automated detailed reports on entire datasets, Dtale integrates advanced libraries like Plotly and Seaborn , **doeasyeda** allows users more control and flexibility in visualizing specific aspects of their data through its range of plotting functions from altair library. **doeasyeda** has the following key features:

* **User-Friendly** : **doeasyeda** is built with simplicity in mind. The functions are easy to use, allowing users to generate insightful plots with minimal coding effort.
* **Versatile Plotting Functions** : The package includes a variety of plotting functions, each tailored to display data effectively. These functions cater to different data types and visualization needs.
* **Focus on Standard EDA Plots** : The package emphasizes standard EDA plots, ensuring that users can cover the fundamental aspects of data visualization in their analysis.

## Developer Note

Direct to the root of the project repository

1. To create a new virtual environment in Conda with Python, use the following commands in the terminal :

```
$ conda create --name doeasyeda python=3.9.0 -y
```

2. To use this new environment for developing, we need to activate the virtual environment:

```
$ conda activate doeasyeda
```

3. To install the needed packages via poetry, run the following command. If poetry hasn't been set up yet, please following [this link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installtion.

```
$ poetry install
```

4. The set up is done, you are free to use the doeasyeda package now! Please check the function section above on how to use the package.

## Usage

Our package primarily utilizes the gapminder dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our plotting functions. However, the functions within **doeasyeda** are designed to be flexible and can be applied to a wide range of datasets, making this package a valuable tool for any data scientist or analyst looking to conduct comprehensive EDA.

Below is a simple quick start example:

```
import pandas as pd

from doeasyeda.create_scatter_plot import create_scatter_plot
from doeasyeda.create_line_plot import create_line_plot
from doeasyeda.create_hist_plot import create_hist_plot
from doeasyeda.create_area_plot import create_area_plot

df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')
```

**Creating scatter plot:**

```
create_scatter_plot(df, 'continent', 'lifeExp', color='continent', 
                    title='Life Exp by Continent', x_title= 'Continent', y_title='Life Exp')
```


**Creating histogram:**

```
df_grouped1 = df.groupby(['continent'])['lifeExp'].sum().reset_index()
create_hist_plot(df_grouped1, 'continent', 'lifeExp', color='continent', 
                 title='Average Life Exp by Continent', x_title= 'Continent', y_title='Average Life Exp')
```

**Creating area plot:**

```
df_grouped2 = df.groupby(['continent', 'year'])['population'].sum().reset_index()
create_area_plot(df_grouped2, 'year', 'population', color='continent', 
                 title='Total Population by Continent', x_title= 'Continent', y_title='Total Population')
```

**Creating line plot:**

```
df['gdp'] = df['gdpPercap'] * df['population']
df_grouped3 = df.groupby(['continent', 'year'])[['population', 'gdp']].sum().reset_index()
df_grouped3['gdpPercap'] = df_grouped3['gdp']/df_grouped3['population']
create_line_plot(df_grouped3, 'year', 'gdpPercap', color='continent', 
                 title=' GDP per capita by Continent', x_title= 'Continent', y_title='GDP per capita')
```
